## Installation

### Via Docker
- Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (Required!)
- Download the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/cgtuebingen/hyperrealistic_indoor_streetview/blob/e70b5098cc485d6f7ac06f7e6e20f7c50f8afe00/docker-compose.yml)
- Create a directory called `public` in the same directory as the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/cgtuebingen/hyperrealistic_indoor_streetview/blob/e70b5098cc485d6f7ac06f7e6e20f7c50f8afe00/docker-compose.yml)
- Place any splats you want to use inside the public folder
- run `docker compose up` in the terminal with the working directory set to the directory you saved the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/cgtuebingen/hyperrealistic_indoor_streetview/blob/e70b5098cc485d6f7ac06f7e6e20f7c50f8afe00/docker-compose.yml)

### By yourself on your machine
**Requirements:** [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) and yarn (install via `npm install -g yarn`)
- Pull the code from [GitHub](https://github.com/cgtuebingen/hyperrealistic_indoor_streetview): `git clone git@github.com:cgtuebingen/hyperrealistic_indoor_streetview.git`
- Run `yarn dev` in the terminal in the root directory of the project (should be hyperrealistic_indoor_streetview)
