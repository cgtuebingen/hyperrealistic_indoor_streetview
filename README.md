## Overview
**Hyperrealistic Indoor Streetview** is a project that brings high-fidelity, photorealistic 3D reconstructions of indoor environments to the web. This project utilizes state-of-the-art techniques such as Gaussian Splatting and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) to create a dynamic and interactive experience of indoor scenes, directly accessible via web browsers.

The pipeline includes several steps such as data acquisition, preprocessing, training, and rendering, and leverages powerful computing clusters for optimizing the scene data. The final result can be explored interactively, offering a smooth and immersive user experience.

### Key Features
- **Photorealistic 3D reconstructions**: Leveraging NeRF and Gaussian Splatting techniques.
- **Interactive Web Viewing**: Real-time exploration of indoor environments in web browsers using React.
- **Performance Improvements**: Over other solutions through culling and unloading of splats. 
- **Navigation Through Buildings**: Display arrows that lead you to your destination.

## Getting Started
You will find detailed instructions and tutorials on setting up the local environment, training models, and deploying results in the [project wiki](https://github.com/cgtuebingen/hyperrealistic_indoor_streetview/wiki).
